function [bounds,ok]=TextBounds(window,text,yPositionIsBaseline,centerTheText)
% bounds=TextBounds(window,string [,yPositionIsBaseline=0][,centerTheText=0])
%
% Returns "bounds", the smallest enclosing rect for the drawn text,
% relative to the current location. This bound is based on the actual
% pixels drawn, so it incorporates effects of text smoothing, etc. "text"
% may be a cell array or matrix of one or more strings. The strings are
% drawn one on top of another, at the same initial position, before the
% bounds are calculated. This returns the smallest box that will contain
% all the strings. The prior contents of the scratch window are lost.
% Usually it should be an offscreen window, so the user won't see it. The
% scratch window should be at least twice as wide and high as the text, to
% cope with uncertainties about text direction (e.g. Hebrew) and some
% unusual characters that extend greatly to the left of their nominal
% starting point. The second output argument "ok" is true if the text was
% not clipped by the window. (The test assumes the pixels in the character
% are connected. A far flung component, such as an accent, might be clipped
% and not detected.)
%
% If you only know your nominal text size and number of characters, you
% might do this to create your scratch window:
%
% Get the bounding box.
% textSize=48;
% string='Good morning.';
% yPositionIsBaseline=1; % 0 or 1
% window=Screen('OpenWindow',0,255);
% woff=Screen('OpenOffscreenWindow',window,[],[0 0 2*textSize*length(string) 2*textSize]);
% Screen(woff,'TextFont','Arial');
% Screen(woff,'TextSize',textSize);
% t=GetSecs;
% bounds=TextBounds(woff,string,yPositionIsBaseline)
% fprintf('TextBounds took %.3f seconds.\n',GetSecs-t);
% Screen('Close',woff);
%
% Show that it's correct by using the bounding box to frame the text.
% x0=100;
% y0=100;
% Screen(window,'TextFont','Arial');
% Screen(window,'TextSize',textSize);
% Screen('DrawText',window,string,x0,y0,0,255,yPositionIsBaseline);
% Screen('FrameRect',window,0,InsetRect(OffsetRect(bounds,x0,y0),-1,-1));
% Screen('Flip',window);
% Speak('Click to quit');
% GetClicks;
% Screen('Close',window);
%
% The suggested window size in that call is generously large because there
% aren't any guarantees from the font makers about how big the text might
% be for a specified point size. Set your window's font, size, and
% (perhaps) style before calling TextBounds.
%
% Be warned that TextBounds and TextCenteredBounds are slow (taking many
% seconds) if the window is large. They use the whole window, so if the
% window is 1024x1024 they process a million pixels. The slow speed is due
% to Screen 'GetImage'. Its processing time is proportional to the number
% of pixels in the window. On my 2017 MacBook, Screen 'GetImage' of a
% 6000x6000 window takes 0.7 s. So getting bounds of 10 letters takes 7 s,
% which makes observers very impatient. So keep your window small.

% 9/1/98   dgp wrote it.
% 3/19/00  dgp debugged it.
% 11/17/02 dgp Added fix, image1(:,:,1), suggested by Keith Schneider to
%              support 16 and 32 bit images.
% 9/16/04  dgp Suggest a pixelSize of 1.
% 12/16/04 dgp Fixed handling of cell array.
% 12/17/04 dgp Round x0 so bounds will always be integer. Add comment about
%              speed.
% 1/18/05  dgp Added Charles Collin's two e suggestion for textHeight.
% 1/28/05  dgp Cosmetic.
% 2/4/05   dgp Support both OSX and OS9.
% 12/22/07 mk  Significant rewrite to adapt to current PTB-3.
% 12/16/15 dgp Added yPositionIsBaseline argument.
% 01/10/16 mk  Switch GetImage buffer from backBuffer to drawBuffer for
%              compatibility with use of onscreen window as scratch window
%              with imaging pipeline active.
% 01/6/17  dgp Added fourth argument to implement the tiny change needed
%              for TextCenteredBounds. This makes TextCenteredBounds a
%              trivial wrapper that automatically tracks improvements made
%              to TextBounds.
% 10/10/18 dgp For unicode support, we now pass the string to DrawText as a
%              double.
% 8/7/19   dgp Detect clipping of bounds by window, issue warning, and
%              return second argument "ok". Updated comments about speed.
